Scraping the Concept2 rowing ranking boards

Concept2 is a fitness equipment company that produces rowing machines. They have a community component to their website, allowing users of their rowers to log and upload their workout and rowing data. Users can choose to have their workouts ranked on several rankings boards based on time or distance. The scrape script allows users to scrape the ranking boards, to collect the data as json files. The merge script merges all scraped files and convert the merge into a csv. The visualizations script is incomplete, but an initial attempt to normalize some data and create visualizations using the seaborn package.
